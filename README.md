----

A plugin that does one thing only: **Detect** and **Manage** duplicate items in [![zotero](https://www.zotero.org/support/lib/exe/fetch.php?tok=2735f1&media=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.zotero.org%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Fpromote%2Fzotero-logo-128x31.png)](https://www.zotero.org/).

The plugin can detect if the newly imported item is a duplicate of an existing item in the library.
If so, it will prompt you to process the duplicate items.

The actions you can take are:

1. **Keep This**: Save the last imported item and delete the rest.
2. **Keep Others**: Delete the last imported item and save the rest.
3. **Keep All**: Keep both the new item and the existing item.
4. **Merge Manually**: Go to Duplicate Panel and merge the duplicate item manually.

*If you find this project helpful, please consider giving it a star* ‚≠ê. *It would be a great encouragement for me!*

## Duplicate Dialog

By default, or you have selected `Always Ask` in the settings,
a dialog will pop up when you import a new item that is a duplicate of an existing item.
